# cassandra_practice
This repo contains a practice of ETL process using Appache Cassandra

## cassandra_practice.ipynb
This jupyter notebook file shows all the implemented practice. It first pre-processed existing CSV data for an Apache Cassandra ETL pipeline in PART 1. In Part 2, actual ETL processs was tried. The important point is that, unlike RDBMS, target queries should be defined in advance, in order to build NoSQL database like Apache Cassandra.
